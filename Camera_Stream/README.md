# Stream over HTTP from the OT2 camera

The OT2 has a webcam! It would be great to stream it over HTTP.

These instructions rely on your OT2 running Raspbian as described [here](https://github.com/theosanderson/Advanced_OT2/tree/master/Raspbian_OT2).

Install motion:
```sudo apt-get install motion```

Make a configuration file
```
mkdir ~/.motion
nano ~/.motion/motion.conf
```

Paste these settings in:

```

```
